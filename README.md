# Overview
Central repo for all planning and agiling the work flow. Do NOT fork this.

## How to edit this repo

As stated above, do **not** fork this repo as we do with the others. You may notice with this particular repo, we all have push access as collaborators. The idea is to create long-term branches, one for each collaborator. Those branches then are worked on individually, and merged into master when appropriate.

### Why we are using this approach

Since the purpose of this repo is an overview of the app in general, there is no need for a full-blown work flow to take place just to make planning edits. Add, or change what you need to on your own branch, then push that branch. Then merge it into master via a pull request on github. Preferrably, do not merge to your own master and push to the repo's master. 

## What this repo is for

The purpose of this repo is for planning and vision ideas. 

* **If you have an idea**
  > Create an issue, with an enhancement tag, and perhaps an ideal release version to be included in. Also, assign it to the approriate person, project, and perhaps milestone *if you are using that process*
* **If you have a mockup**
  > Add it either to the mockup folder (bad), or as a hosted link to the MockUps.md (better)
